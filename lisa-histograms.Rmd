A few days ago Bradley Boehmke [recreated a graphic](http://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/weather_graphic) from Edward Tufte's classic book Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd Ed. (page 30). The implementation looked like a lot of yak shaving (especially for the annotations) but it's still (or because of that) a great piece.

Then yesterday I stumbled over [Lisa Charlotte Rost](http://www.lisacharlotterost.de/)'s [blog](http://lisacharlotterost.github.io/) and really liked the article and the accompanying visualization about [Styling Choropleth Maps](http://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2014/12/14/Styling-Choropleth-Maps%202/). You should go read that article now if you are interested in mapping. I'll wait for you here... Welcome back! Where were we? So, I asked her how she created it and upon learning that the final graphic was put together in Illustrator I started wondering if this could be done with [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/). Inspired by Bradley's post I went to work.

_This is Lisa's original image:_

## Used packages

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(RCurl)
require(ggplot2)
require(grid)
require(gridExtra)
require(maps)
require(RColorBrewer) # not really used - I thought i'd need it
require(classInt) # Jenks natural breaks
```

There are really no suprises here. I am using `RCurl` to download the data, `ggplot` and `maps` to draw histograms and... well... maps. There is only one package that I hadn't used before and that is `classInt`. QGIS' natural breaks coloring used an Algorithm by [George Jenks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization) which is to my good fortune implemented in that package. I was also thinking that I'd need `RColorBrewer` but Lisa seems to be using a sligtly treaked version of the [YlOrRd](http://colorbrewer2.org/) palette so I ended up just copying her colors into a manual color scale.

## Preparing the data

The first thing I did, was getting the state shapes from the `map` package and download the current [US census data](https://www.census.gov) from the web.

```{r}
states <- map_data("state")
population<- read.csv(textConnection(getURL('https://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2014/files/NST_EST2014_ALLDATA.csv')))[-(1:5),]
```

Next I calculated some descriptive statistics to help me with the task of cutting the range of population sizes into the different intervals needed for the QGIS styling modes described in Lisa's article. I then computed the breaks of the intervals and added the information to which interval each state belongs to the `population` data frame via the very useful `cut` method.

```{r}
min = min(population$CENSUS2010POP)
max = max(population$CENSUS2010POP)
diff <- max - min
std = sd(population$CENSUS2010POP)

equal.interval = seq(min, max, by = diff/6)
quantile.interval = quantile(population$CENSUS2010POP, probs=seq(0, 1, by = 1/6))
std.interval = c(seq(min, max, by=std), max)
natural.interval = classIntervals(population$CENSUS2010PO, n = 6, style = 'jenks')$brks

population$population.equal = cut(population$CENSUS2010POP, breaks=equal.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)
population$population.quantile = cut(population$CENSUS2010POP, breaks=quantile.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)
population$population.std = cut(population$CENSUS2010POP, breaks=std.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)
population$population.natural = cut(population$CENSUS2010POP, breaks=natural.interval, include.lowest = TRUE)
```

Now every state (represented as a row in the `population` data frame) had not only it's population (in the `CENSUS2010POP` column) associated to it but also the information which bucket it belongs to for the different styles. Here are the relevant fields of the first few rows.

```{r}
head(population[c('NAME', 'CENSUS2010POP', 'population.equal', 'population.quantile', 'population.std', 'population.natural')])
```

Fortunately the `states` data frame had a field called `region` that closely matched the `name` field of our `population` data frame - just one of them was all lower case. Thus by adding another column using the right string transformation enabled me to `merge` (or you might be more familiar with the word _join_ for this kind of operation) the two data frames. This gave me one big data frame with all the information I needed to create the histograms on the left of Lisa's graphic and also the maps.

```{r}
population$region = tolower(population$NAME)
choro <- merge(states, population, sort = FALSE, by = "region")
choro <- choro[order(choro$order), ]
```

## Creating the visualization

The next code snipped was actually created much later when tweaking the visuals. It creates a stripped down theme without borders, grid and axes so that I am able to match Lisa's style.

```{r}
common.theme = theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    plot.title=element_blank(),
    axis.text.x=element_blank(),
    axis.title.x=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, face='bold'),
    axis.text.y=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
map.theme = common.theme + theme(axis.title.y=element_blank())
```

The color scheme was also created late in the process. Of course it needs to be declared before using it in the charts. Therefore it is here in the next code block. Lisa uses a color scale that matches the YlOrRd theme from Cynthia Brewer's color scales very closely but it's a little darker. Therefore I simply used a color picker and colied her colors as hex calues to create my own color scale.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=1.2}
colors <- c("#FDC25A", "#FD7834", "#E9151C", "#891E14", "#45150C", "#000000") # copied from lisa's maps - not exactly but close to YlOrRd
scale_fill_lisa <- scale_fill_manual(values=colors)
qplot(color, fill=color, data=data.frame(color=colors)) + scale_fill_lisa + guides(fill=FALSE) + common.theme + ylab(NULL)
```

To be able to join the different histograms with the vertical lines I had even more theming to do. Depending on where the graph is located I added a negative margin an the top, bottom or both.

```{r}
top.graph = theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0,.5,-.5,.5), "line"))
middle.graph = theme(plot.margin = unit(c(-.5,.5,-.5,.5), "line"))
bottom.graph = theme(plot.margin = unit(c(-.5,.5,.5,.5), "line"))
```

To still get a reasonable amount of whitespace between the histograms I hardcoded the y-scale.

```{r}
common.scale_y = scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,60))
```

I created reusable fragments for the vertical lines indicating the states' population data points and and the small black line segments at the bottom of each histogram. 

```{r}
common.vline = geom_vline(aes(xintercept=CENSUS2010POP), color=colors[1], size=0.5)

interval_rug <- function(breaks) { return(geom_linerange(aes(x=CENSUS2010POP), ymin=-5, ymax=0, data=data.frame(CENSUS2010POP=breaks))) }
```

Finally everything was coming together into the actual hitograms. To not repeat myself to much I refactored the code into a function that assembles the histograms from just a few parameters.

```{r}
hist <- function(interval, position, label) {
  return(
     ggplot(population, aes(x=CENSUS2010POP)) +
       common.vline +
       geom_histogram(breaks=interval, fill='black', color='black') +
       geom_line(y=0) + # faux x-axis
       interval_rug(interval) +
       common.scale_y +
       position +
       common.theme +
       ylab(label)
  )
}

hist.equal <- hist(equal.interval, top.graph, "Equal Interval")
hist.quantile <- hist(quantile.interval, middle.graph, "Quantile")
hist.std <- hist(std.interval, middle.graph, "Std Deviation")
hist.natural <- hist(natural.interval, bottom.graph, "Natural breaks")
```

I created a similar function for the maps. One new thing that I learned was `aes_string` -- apparently you can't put a variable into an `aes(fill=...)` call. 

```{r}

map <- function(cuts) {
  return(
    ggplot(choro) + geom_polygon(aes_string(y='lat', x='long', group='group', fill=cuts), color="white", size=.2) + scale_fill_lisa + guides(fill=FALSE) + map.theme
    )
}

map.equal <- map('population.equal')
map.quantile <- map('population.quantile')
map.std <- map('population.std')
map.natural <- map('population.natural')
```

By far the most ugly part of the whole endeavour was creating the header annotation in a way that looked reasonably similar to what Lisa had built. This reminded me about the feelings I had when reading Bradley Boehmke's article and it brought Bret Victor's [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662) to my mind. Manipulating symbols is just not a nice way to do (information) design work - especially with a slow feedback loop like this. In the end I got reasonably close the the original.

```{r}
hist.title <- ggplot(data.frame(minmax=c(min,max)), aes(x=minmax)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
  geom_blank() +
  geom_linerange(ymin=0, ymax=1, size=.5) +
  geom_line(y=1, size=.5) +
  common.theme +
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(.5,.5,0,.5), "line")) + ylab('') +
  annotation_custom(grob=textGrob(label=paste(' ',format(min/1000000, digits=2),'m people'), just='left', gp=gpar(fontsize = 10, fontface='bold')), xmin=min, xmax=min) +
  annotation_custom(grob=textGrob(label=paste(format(max/1000000, digits=2),'m people '), just='right', gp=gpar(fontsize = 10, fontface='bold')), xmin=max, xmax=max)
```

Then I had to assemble everything into a single chart. This last snipped was also a piece of constant experimentation. Getting the width and height ratios right wasn't exactly a fun exercise.

This is my final result.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
grid.arrange(hist.title, textGrob(label="Population in\nUS-american states", just='left', x= unit(0, "npc"), gp=gpar(fontsize = 10, fontface='bold')),
             hist.equal, map.equal,
             hist.quantile, map.quantile,
             hist.std, map.std,
             hist.natural, map.natural,
             ncol=2, widths=c(4,1), heights=c(1.2,3,3,3,3))
```

## Conclusion

I am quite happy with the result. I proved to myself that it is possible to recreate Lisa's graphic in R. While this was a fun exercise it was also a confirmation for myself (which didn't come unexpected) that R is not the tool to design graphics. It's awesome to get results fast. Exploring datasets with `ggplot2` is a bliss. Tweaking the visuals however took longer than getting the basic graphics done. Maybe preparing a basic graph in R and exporting to SVG is a viable solution? I haven't done much research yet.

I hope you enjoyed the article and could learn a thing or two. Again a big shout out to [Lisa](http://www.lisacharlotterost.de/) for creating the original graphic and to [Bradley](http://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/weather_graphic) to inspire me to recreate it.
